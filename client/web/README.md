# Palette Hub Web Client

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Icons

This project uses [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) for all of it's icons along with the [React npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-bootstrap-icons).

## UI/UX Design

This project uses [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/) for Bootstrap 5 for the UI/UX design. Further customization is done with [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) in the respective `styles` folders.

## Development Mode

By default the parent directory `client` has a `Dockerfile` that compiles a production build and adds it to a Nginx web server to be served statically. During development you will need run the dev docker compose environment using the `scripts/start_dev` script to access the REST API. 

Once the environment is set up you can run the react app in development mode with the following command:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
